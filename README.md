README: MultiLayerLattice for FluidLatticeAI Integration
This code implements a  MultiLayerLattice class designed for potential integration with the FluidLatticeAI framework. It utilizes concepts of DimensionData structures and incorporates functionalities for information processing within a layered structure.

FluidLatticeAI (theoretical concept) is envisioned as an AI framework inspired by physical processes like fluid dynamics. It might employ a lattice structure where data processing units (nodes) interact with their neighbors.

Universal Data Representation System (theoretical concept)  is another hypothetical system that aims to establish a standardized way to represent various data types.

Possible Uses with FluidLatticeAI

This MultiLayerLattice class can be a building block for constructing more complex AI systems within the FluidLatticeAI framework. Here are some potential applications:

Modeling Hierarchical Features: The layered structure allows representing data with varying levels of detail or abstraction. Lower layers might capture low-level features, while higher layers handle more complex or global patterns.
Spatiotemporal Processing: The concept of neighboring nodes exchanging information can be used to model spatial relationships between data points. Additionally, incorporating memory within DimensionData enables considering temporal aspects.
Learning and Adaptation: The DimensionData structure includes features like learningRate and learningWeights, suggesting potential for incorporating learning mechanisms within the framework.

Current Functionality of the Code

The provided code focuses on the  MultiLayerLattice class and offers functionalities like:

Processing within Nodes: The LatticeNode::process method demonstrates how individual nodes can update their internal state based on input signals, neighboring data, and flow vectors. This update logic can be customized for specific applications.
Information Propagation: The MultiLayerLattice::propagate method enables propagating information through the layers. This implementation includes smoothing and activation steps (ReLU in this example).
Information Exchange between Layers: The MultiLayerLattice::exchangeInformation method allows layers to exchange information using weighted averaging based on flow vectors.
Note: This code snippet showcases core functionalities but represents a work in progress. Specific logic for data processing, learning, and interaction with the broader FluidLatticeAI framework would need further development.
